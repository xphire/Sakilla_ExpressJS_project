# ExpressJS-Projects

This repo contains express js projects. 

Projects are on a  beginner level expertise

The project is based on the Sakilla Mysql database.

The tar file of the sakilla database was imported into Postgres 15 using the pgAdmin GUI

The actor table was used.

REST API CRUD methods were implemented following the MVC model,using the express framework

A minimalistic authorization method using jwt was also implemented with all the routes protected by authentication/authorization

Much thanks to John Smilga from coding addicts and the entire Freecodecamp team.
